## Overview & Purpose of Project:

Purpose of this project is to explore NYC city bike data and analyze them to prepare a proposal for bike sharing program in Des Moines 
to the investor.


## Analysis Results from NYC citybike data:

### Peak hours during peak month

Normally, month of August is the peak summer at NYC and analyzing the trip data during different hours of the day gives us an idea
when the trips are more so that the company needs to maintain the availability of the bikes. What it appears that 5 PM and 6 PM the
number of trips are maximum in the month of August which is somewhere between 200,000 and 250,000. Please refer to the visualization below.

##  Summary:
   After analyzing the NYC data, few conclusions can be made
		- Bike subscribers are more than customers. That means Bike sharing business likelihood will fetch more subscription money which is always better.
        - Weekdays during Start of the working hour (8 AM) and returning from work hour (5 PM or 6PM), bikes are utilized more. 
		  That means bikes are used more frequently by working professionals (not tourists). Normally working professionals ride bike more responsibly than tourists.
        - Through better management of bikes (Like where maximum trips start..keep more bikes there), this business can be well operated.
